      My name is Liam Craver; I am a developer and a designer from New Orleans, Louisiana.
      My passion is technology; I'm always eager to learn about the latest gadgets or the
      new features that are in the latest patches of my favorite software.

      I am an alumnus of <a href="http://www.nocca.com/" class="block">New Orleans Center for Creative Arts</a> and <a href="http://www.edline.net/pages/bfhsla" class="block">Benjamin Franklin HighSchool</a>;
      currently I am pursuing a computer science degree at the <a href="http://www.louisiana.edu/" class="block">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>.

      I work freelance when I can during the schoolyear, but especially during the summer;
      if you want, check out my work page; open to working on projects of all sorts,
      I will fit it in however I can.

    <p class="text-body-1">
      Most of the time, I am a pretty ordinary person. I say things on Tumblr and Google+.
      My code ends up on GitHub most of the time.

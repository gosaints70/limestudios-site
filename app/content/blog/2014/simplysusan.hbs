#About the Client
Born and raised in New Orleans, Susan de la Houssaye grew up in a city of collectors -
antiques, art, Mardi Gras beads, and whatever people could get their hands on. All
she ever wanted to do was organize them into piles, colors, stacks or storage bins.
If ever a drawer or closet was cluttered, she wanted to rearrange it to make it harmonious.

#Project Scope
I was hired by Susan to completely redo her businesses' website [simplysusansite.com](http://simplysusansite.com)

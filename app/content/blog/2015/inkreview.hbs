#Game Info
INK is a fast-paced, abstract platformer about discovering the world around you, using paint.
It is a small, but challenging game that Zack Bell put together post-Ludem Dare 32 upon seeing Dittomat's game entry.
INK is currently only available on the Windows platform. Keyboard and Gamepad controls are supported.
